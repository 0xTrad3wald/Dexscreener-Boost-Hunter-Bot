# Dexscreener-Boost-Hunter-Bot
This Bot is a Node.js script written in Typescript and it scans the Boost Endpoints of Dexscreener for boosted contracts on the Solana Blockchain. If it finds fresh boosted contract it will do a rugcheck on the contract by using the rugcheck.xyz API and create a message as output that is ready for integration into your favorite tool (Discord, TG).
